DSDIN
==========

A next-generation blockchain for Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).

Optimized for scalability, massive data processing and AI via smart contracts inside wormholes.

Has a build-in oracle for integration with real-world data, particularly for high-volume industrial data.

Comes with a naming system, for developerability.

Written in the best concurrent programming language -- Erlang.

Please see the latest [release notes][release-notes] if you want to run the software or just [follow the progress of the project in Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2124891).
